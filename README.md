# Unique Tile Improvements For All

Running an only modded Civs game and still want to use the base game unique tile improvements? Now you can.

Makes the unique tile improvements of Terrace Farm, Polder, and Moai able to be built by any Civ, not just Inca, Netherlands, and Polynesia respectively.

This also enables Barbarian Encampments for use in the map editor because apparently that isn't a default feature.
